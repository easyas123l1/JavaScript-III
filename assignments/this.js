* 2. Whenever a function is called by a preceding dot, the object before that dot is this.

// Principle 1

// code example for Window Binding

function window() {
  console.log(this);
}
window();

// Principle 2

// code example for Implicit Binding
let greet = {
  greeting: 'Hello ',
  speak: function(name) {
    console.log(this.greeting + name);
  }
}

greet.speak('Andrew');
// Principle 3

// code example for New Binding

function NeighbourSpeak(name) {
  this.greeting = 'Hello ';
  this.name = name;
  this.speak = function() {
    console.log(this.greeting + this.name);
    console.log(this);
  }
}
